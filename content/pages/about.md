In Code Club, kids have fun while learning the fundamentals of computer
science. We focus on the creative and problem solving aspects of
computer science, and using the tools of computing to understand the
world around us. Kids practice the design process and design thinking
as they plan, code and test their own interactive stories, mini-games,
and multimedia productions. Using Scratch, MIT's visual programming
language, your child will master the core skills of computer
programming which they can take to text based languages (like Java,
Python, or Haskell) as their skills develop. All skill levels are
supported and instruction will be tailored to meet your child where
they are.

How it Works
------------
Each week in the Club, meetings we will focus on a core idea of computer
science and kids will be challenged to integrate these ideas into their
projects. Because Scratch is web based software, they will be able to
show and share their work at home and continue working outside of the
Club, if they want to. Each week the Club facilitators will post goals
for the week, a summary of our meeting, and optional extension
activities that can be done at home.

Code Club is a PACC after school enrichment program at [PS 9](http://www.ps9brooklyn.org). Students
will be picked up from their classroom and then join us in the computer
lab for a 90-minute session. Code Club meets on Wednesdays from
4pm-5:30pm, for the 10-week winter session. It is available to students in grades 2-5.
