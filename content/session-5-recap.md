Summary
-----------------------------------------
This week coders continued working on their multimedia projects and explored the use of audio in their projects. Beginning coders were taught how to create a sample projects with step by step directions. They used [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5cdYRhWgI2MUWFSN2g2Rnk4b2M/view?usp=sharing) document to help guide the process.
