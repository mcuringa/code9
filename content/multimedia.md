Summary: Coders will make a multimedia presentation to tell a story or give a presentation.

Overview
-----------------------------------------
This project will span sessions 3-5 where coders will create their own multimedia project. Coders will dive deeper into the audio, drawing, and costume tools within Scratch. The process of initial project planning and iteration based on feedback will be implemented. Students will be introduced to the computational thinking concepts of `repetition` (loops) and `algorithms` in the context of animating their characters as they move.

Goals
-----------------------------------------
1. Learn about the design thinking/project development process.
2. Initiate planning and sketch out first idea for the project.
3. Scratch goals:
    1. Confirm everyone has an account and can log in.
    2. Demonstrate and practice using the audio tool.
    3. Demonstrate and practice using the drawing tool.
    4. Build and edit a multimedia project


Introduction (15 minutes)
-----------------------------------------
Introduce the new project and show a good example (*any ideas of which
project?*) of a project on Scratch. Have a group discussion of what made the
project desirable. "Look inside" to inspect the code, costumes, and audio
clips. Discuss basic structure and identify the beginning, middle, and end.

Discuss the design process, editing and revisions based on feedback.

Planning (15 minutes)
-----------------------------------------
Introduce planning sheet (Shared on G Docs) and demonstrate a filled out
version using the project previously reviewed. Provide coder with blank
planning sheet and have them brainstorm and plan initial idea.

Split into Groups (60 minutes)
-----------------------------------------

Novel Coders: (Dom and Loreto)
-----------------------------------------
*Demonstration and Practice*

- Audio tool and drawing demonstration
- Provide with mini project cards to practice:
  - Making a drawing
  - Recording/ adding sound to project.
  - Switching between costumes (sprite talking)
  - Switching backgrounds

*Start working on own project using planning sheet*

Advanced Coders: (Matt is the boss here...)
----------------------------------------- 
For this project, the advanced group
will continue to explore multimedia aspects (similar to the beginning coders),
but will have a greater focus on organizing their code and creating re-usable
functions through custom blocks. They will use variables and Scratch's
messaging (event) system to make their programs more flexible and modular, and
less reliant on hardcoded timings.
