Summary: Coders will make a multimedia presentation to tell a story or give a presentation.

Overview
-----------------------------------------
This project will span sessions 3-5 where coders will create their own multimedia project working in small groups. Coders will dive deeper into the audio, drawing, and costume tools within Scratch. The process of initial project planning and iteration based on feedback will be implemented.

Goals
-----------------------------------------
1. Learn about the project development process. initiate planning
2. Initiate planning and sketching out of first idea for the project.
3. Scratch goals:
    1. Confirm everyone has an account and can log in.
    2. Demonstrate and practice using the audio tool.
    3. Demonstrate and practice using the drawing tool and/ or explore external drawing tool.
    4. Search for media outside of Scratch community and upload into project.
    5. Establish roles for team members.
    6. Start to build and edit a multimedia project.


Introduction (15-20 minutes)
-----------------------------------------

Introduce the new project and show a good example (*https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/88927048/*) of a project on Scratch. Have a group discussion of what made the project desirable. "Look inside" to inspect the code, costumes, and audio clips. Discuss the basic structure of the sample and identify the beginning, middle, and end as well as story elements.

Discuss the design process, roles, editing and revisions based on feedback. The process of collaboration in Scratch will be reviewed using the remix and backpack features.

Planning (15 minutes)
-----------------------------------------
Introduce the planning sheet [https://goo.gl/pNjPaF](https://goo.gl/pNjPaF) and  have the group fill out a version using the project previously reviewed.

Divide into groups and provide each team with a blank planning sheet. Each team will then brainstorm and plan initial idea as well as delineate team roles. Teams may spend some time investigating Scratch projects for ideas.

Working Groups (60 minutes)
-----------------------------------------
##### Beginners
- Practice creating and adding a sound to their project.
- Practice creating adding a drawing to their project.
- Complete the `Favorite Things` activity in the walk through projects.

##### Intermediates
- Begin to work on project using planning sheet.
- Record own media.
- Upload and attribute external images or sounds.

##### Advanced
- Start working on their project.
- Learn about `actions on click` and `showing messages`
