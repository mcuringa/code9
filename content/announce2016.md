Welcome parents and coders to the 2016 Winter Session of Code Club 9.  This session we will introduce new and returning coders to the Scratch platform to make games and multimedia projects. The aim of our club is to introduce budding coders to programming principles and foster a love of inventing, creating, problem solving, and learning.

Sessions will be held at the PS 9 computer lab on Wednesdays from 4:00 to 5:30 on the following dates:
Jan 13, 20, 27
Feb 3,10,24
March 2,9,16,23

For the first session please be sure to have started a Scratch account for your child. Accounts can be created at the following link (scratch.mit.edu). If you have multiple children attending the club be sure to have an account for each child. Scratch is a free web based tool created by MIT which we will be using primarily to create our projects. Once you have the username and password, please share this information with us so we may facilitate logging in. For convenience, please fill out the following form:
