% The Best Cloud IDE for Teaching Programming

As a software developer, I have a love-hate relationship with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). On the _love_ side, they can take a lot of the tedium out of computer programming. Especially when I was writing Java for 8+ hours a day, I loved Eclipse and later IntelliJ for automating features like reformatting code, renaming things (packages, classes, variables), generating getter/setter methods, importing classes I was using, and automating tests. Integrated step through debuggers and other instrumentation are also essential tools. Still, I kind of _hate_ useing IDEs. First, and foremost, they never feature best-in-class text editors. Writing and editing text remains central to comptuer programming. Whether you prefer emacs or vi(m), or you are a fan of Sublime or Atom, _the features and responsiveness of IDE editors always fall short._ Other minor complaints include sluggish performance, hogging ram that should be used to run my programs instead of theirs, and being forced into a project organization dictated by the IDE.

Now that I split my concentration between writing software and teaching programming, I have a different perpsective on IDEs. As tools for teaching, at their best, they reduce the complexity of setting up a software development environment, and generally reduce the cognitive load of learning to program. At the same time, IDEs are generally designed for professionals -- not novice programmers. Accordingly, they can be confusing and, even for professionals, require a good deal of customization before they begin to save time and effort. Further, the very time-saving features that make them useful can occlude programming language and computer science concepts from novices.

In this article I look at several popular web-based IDEs from the persepective of an instructional designer and computer science educator. For this exercise, I will empathize with college students in their first two semesters of CS classes as well as children and adolescents who are learning CS for the first time as part of their primary or secondary education.
