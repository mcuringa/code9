    <p>In Code Club, kids have fun while learning the fundamentals of computer science. We focus on the creative and problem solving aspects of computer science, and using the tools of computing to understand the world around us. Kids practice the design process and design thinking as they plan, code and test their own interactive stories, mini-games, and multimedia productions. Using Scratch, MITâ€™s visual programming language, your child will master the core skills of computer programming which they can take to text based languages (like Java, Python, or Haskell) as their skills develop. All skill levels are supported and instruction will be tailored to meet your child where they are.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
<p>Each week in the Club, meetings we will focus on a core idea of computer science and kids will be challenged to integrate these ideas into their projects. Because Scratch is web based software, they will be able to show and share their work at home and continue working outside of the Club, if they want to. Each week the Club facilitators will post goals for the week, a summary of our meeting, and optional extension activities that can be done at home.</p>
<p>Code Club is a PACC after school enrichment program at <a href="http://www.ps9brooklyn.org">PS 9</a>. Students will be picked up from their classroom and then join us in the computer lab for a 90-minute session. Code Club meets on Wednesdays from 4pm-5:30pm, for the 10-week winter session. It is available to students in grades 2-5.</p>
