Slide 1
=======

Hello everyone. We are Zero Day Camp, and we're very happy to have this opportunity to present to you today. Today we're going to tell you about our vision to establish a cutting edge micro maker space and computer science teching lab here in Prospect Heights.

Slide 2
=======

Cynthia is going to tell you about our corporate structure.

I'm going to talk about how we got started and our approach and methods.

Loreto will discuss our success to date and the partners we are working with.

David will share our vision for moving forward and the fabulous maker space we have in the works.

First, we'dl like to introduce ourselves.

Slide 2
=======
I'm Matt Curinga, and I'm a computer programmer, instructional designer, educator and researcher. I founded the graduate program in Educational Technology at Adelphi University where I'm an associate professor. As part of my work, I study how people learn computer science and what types of tools and methods can help them master the field.

=======
Among other things, I helped to establish Zero Day Camp as a not-for profit organization and to wrote the by-laws. Currently, the founders form the Board of Directors. The Board must alwasy have at least 3 members, but they can take on more members when it makes sense to. I've also been working with Loreto to teach the Young Engineers afterschool this Fall. I will help answer any questions in this area after the presentation.

Slide 4
=======

We all know each other through the community and through PS 9 in Prospect Heights, where all of our kids go or have gone to school. We got together to form Zero Day Camp so that we could formalize some of the volunteer work and other projects we had initiated, and to have a vehicle to take our ideas to the next level.

Slide 5
=======
New York City is a leader in the national push to teach computer science and programming as a core field of study in K-12 schools. The mayor has set the admirable and ambitious goal to teach computer science at every level in our public schools. This means, though, that we need to quickly ramp up our competence in the area. We believe that Zero Day Camp can forward this effort by hosting a space where teachers learn the skills and methods of computer science education, supporting kids and their families in learning outside of school, and by testing and releasing tools and curricula that are responsive to the needs of our local community in teaching computer science. Our vision for computing education focuses on the creative aspects of programming, the satisfaction of hands-on physical production, and the critical lenses we need for computer science to become central to broad media literacy campaigns. In our business plan we discuss some of the other interesting organizations with similar models and missions. There is so much work to do in this area that more people working on the problem can only help. I'm going to turn things over to Loreto and she'll take a look at some of our efforts so far along these lines.

Slide 6
=======
The name, Zero Day Camp, embodies our playful approach to computing by combining the term for a security vulnerability and "camp". A "Zero Day" is a security whole or bug that has been previously unknown--it kind of comes out of nowhere. Security researchers, like Project Zero at Google search out zero days so they can publicize and close the vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies might amass them as part of cyberwarfare initiatives, and criminal crackers have recently exploited them for economic gain and to wreak havoc on the world's computer systems. The "Day" from zero day, matches our Day Camp model. As you'll see, one of our core services is running summer and school-year day camps. More broadly, though, the idea of "camp" has gained prevalence in the tech community as an intense learning experience that is not categorized by the rigidity of school, originating in 2003 with the Silicon Valley "Foo Camp."
